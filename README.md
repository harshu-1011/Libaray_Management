The LibarY Management System is a stand-alone application designed to efficiently collect and maintain records of students who borrow books from the library. It utilizes MySQL as the database management system and is implemented using Core Java with the AWT and Swing frameworks. The application can be executed through the Command Prompt (CMD) and requires the XAMPP tool for seamless operation.

## Objective

The main objective of the LibarY Management System is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing library records. This includes the efficient tracking of student information, book borrowing, and maintaining an organized library database. The system aims to streamline the library management process, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records while simplifying administrative tasks.

## Technology

The LibarY Management System is built using the following technologies:

- **MySQL**: It is used as the database management system to store and manage the library records efficiently.
- **Core Java**: The application is developed using Core Java, which provides a robust and platform-independent programming environment.
- **AWT & Swing Framework**: The AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing frameworks are used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) components of the application, offering a rich set of tools for user interaction and visual appeal.

## Tools

To successfully run the LibarY Management System, the following tools are required:

- **CMD (Command Prompt)**: The Command Prompt is used to execute the application and interact with the system through the command-line interface.
- **XAMPP**: XAMPP is a widely-used software package that provides a local web server environment. It includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which are essential for running the MySQL database required by the LibarY Management System.

## Getting Started

To run the LibarY Management System, follow these steps:

1. Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the official website (https://www.apachefriends.org) according to your operating system.
2. Start XAMPP: Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
3. Set up the Database: Open a web browser and enter "http://localhost/phpmyadmin" to access the phpMyAdmin interface. Create a new database named "library" and import the provided SQL script to set up the necessary tables and data.
4. Compile and Execute the Application: Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the project directory. Compile the Java files using the Java compiler, and then execute the application using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by running the main class file.
   
## javac *.java
## java Main


5. Interact with the Application: Once the application is running, you can use the graphical interface to perform various library management tasks, such as adding students, borrowing books, and generating reports.

## Features

The LibarY Management System offers the following features:

- ‚ú® **Student Management**: Add, update, and delete student records, including personal information and borrowing history.
- üìö **Book Management**: Manage the library's book inventory, including adding new books, updating details, and tracking availability.
- üîë **Borrowing System**: Enable students to borrow books from the library, with due date reminders and fine calculation for late returns.
- üìä **Reports and Statistics**: Generate reports on borrowed books, due dates, fines, and other library-related data to facilitate administrative tasks.
- üîç **Search Functionality**: Search and retrieve student or book information based on various criteria such as name, ID, title, or author.

## Conclusion

The LibarY Management System provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing library records. By leveraging MySQL, Core Java, and the AWT and Swing frameworks, the application offers a robust platform to maintain student records, track book borrowing, and generate reports. With the help of XAMPP, the system seamlessly integrates with the MySQL database, ensuring smooth execution and reliable data management.
